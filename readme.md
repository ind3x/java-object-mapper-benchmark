# Object-to-object mapping framework microbenchmark

Multi-layered applications often require to map between different object models (e.g. DTOs and entities). 
Writing such boiler plate mapping code is a tedious and error-prone task.
A lot of object-to-object mapping Java frameworks aims to simplify this work and automate it.
Some uses code instrospection (eg. Dozer). Other uses code generation (ex: MapStruct).
This micro-benchmark compares performance of 9 frameworks. Results could be compared to the benchmark of a code written manually. 

Benchmark are powered by a tool called [JMH](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/) or also known as "Java Microbenchmarking Harness".
JMH is developed by the OpenJDK team.

## Contributing to benchmark


GitHub is for social coding platform: if you want to add another mapping framework or optimize an existing one, we encourage contributions 
through pull requests from [forks of this repository](http://help.github.com/forking/).
If you want to contribute code this way, please reference a GitHub ticket as well covering the specific issue you are addressing.
To add a new mapper, please add a unit test that extends the `AbstractMapperTest` class and declare your mapper into the `MapperBenchmark` class. 


## Data model

The data model used by this benchmark is very basic. It comes from the [Comparison](https://github.com/jhalterman/modelmapper/blob/master/core/src/test/java/org/modelmapper/performance/Comparison.java) class from the ModelMapper framework.
It includes combinations which usually appear in Java Beans, such as:

* Object types
* Collections

## Launch the benchmark

_Pre-requisites: Maven 3.x and a JDK 8 (or above)_

``git clone git://github.com/arey/java-object-mapper-benchmark.git``

``mvn clean install``

``java -jar target/benchmarks.jar``

Optional: To run a single benchmark, such as MapStruct, use `java -jar target/benchmarks.jar -p type=MapStruct`

## Interpreting the Results

The benchmarks measure throughput, given in "ops/time". The time unit used is seconds.
Generally, the score represents the number of graph object mapped per second; the higher the score, the better.

## Results

Tests has been performed on:

* OS: macOS High Sierra
* CPU: 3.1 GHz Intel Core i7, 2 cores, L2 Cache (per Core): 256 KB,  L3 Cache: 4 MB
* RAM: 16 GB 1867 MHz DDR3
* JVM: Oracle 1.8.0_74-b02 64 bits

## Generating plot

1. Run benchmark while exporting results to csv with `java -jar target/benchmarks.jar -rff results.csv -rf csv`
2. Use gnuplot to generate plot with `gnuplot benchmark.plt`. This will output `results.png`.
